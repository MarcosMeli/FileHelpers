<h4>What version of the ExcelStorage must I use ?</h4>

<div class="indent">
<h5><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FileHelpers.ExcelNPOIStorage/">ExcelNPOIStorage</a></h5>

<p><b>Recomended</b>. Uses the excellent <a href="https://github.com/tonyqus/npoi">library NPOI</a>, there is no need to have Excel installed and has a great performance</p>

<p>This storage was developed by: GioVAX</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FileHelpers.ExcelStorage/">ExcelStorage</a></h5>

<p><b>Obsolete</b>. First version of the Storage, needs Excel installed in the production machine and is not recomended (Released to be backward compatible)</p>

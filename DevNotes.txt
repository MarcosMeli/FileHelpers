  Who needs the File Helpers Library ? 
----------------------------------------

  In almost every project there is a need to read/write data from/to a file of a specified format.

  For example for log parsing, data warehouse and OLAP applications, 
  communication between systems, file format transformations 
  (for example from a fixed length to a CSV file).

  This library aims to provide an easy and reliable way to accomplish this task.

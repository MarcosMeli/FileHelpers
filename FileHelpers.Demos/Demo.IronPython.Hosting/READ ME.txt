These demos make use of IronPython, a .NET implementation of the Python
scripting/programming language.  FileHelpers already comes with the 
necessary DLLs, but if you wish to download IronPython separately, you can
find it at: http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/

The demo scripts/programs also require the USPS CIN List file from the 
DEPS service on the US Postal Service's FAST web portal.  This demonstrates
the usage of FileHelpers on a real-world data file; however, this file 
cannot be redistributed due to copyright restrictions.  It is freely available
from the USPS FAST DEPS website at https://fast.usps.com; no login is
necessary, simply use the menus to choose "Resources", then 
"Drop-Ship Product File Download", then the "CIN List File".  Once the file
is finished downloading, unzip it into this demo's directory.  (It should contain
a single file called "CINLIST")

Once you've added the CINLIST file to the demo directory, go ahead and launch the 
pure Python demo by running "demo.bat", or launch the IronPython Hosting demo by running 
Demo.IronPython.Hosting.exe
